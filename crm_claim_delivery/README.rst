==================
crm_claim_delivery
==================

Connects a claim to a delivery order, the claim is intended to be created
internally , therefore it will not be  of type customer or supplier, but we
introduce a new type called "delivery/sale"

The module depends on OCA module crm_claim_type, that introduces the type
categorization for claims.

A new wizard is created where the user will be able to create a claim 
associate it to a delivery order and specify which product is to be claimed.

On the product form we will see all claims connected with that product
with associated delivery and claim date in the tab "Claims".

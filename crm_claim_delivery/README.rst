==================
crm_claim_delivery
==================

Connects a claim to a delivery order, the claim is intended to be created
internally , therefore it will not be  of type customer or supplier, but we
introduce a new type called "delivery/sale"

The module depends on OCA module crm_claim_type, that introduces the type
categorization for claims.

A new wizard is created where the user will be able to create a claim 
associate it to a delivery order and specify which product is to be claimed.

On the product form we will see all claims connected with that product
with associated delivery and claim date.
